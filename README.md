"In this project, I worked on the task of segmentation, which in Farsi could be translated as precise pixel-wise object segmentation. In this project, to ensure the code runs on all systems, I used the Pet_IIIT_Oxford dataset, which contains images of animals. For this, I used Kaggle to run the code. The images are 3-channel, resized to 128x128 dimensions, and undergo data augmentation and normalization as part of the preprocessing. I used the UNet architecture, which is fully implemented in the code, but due to time constraints and hardware limitations, the model was only trained for 10 epochs. In the end, you can see the segmentation result. To run this project, all necessary libraries need to be installed on the system, and then the code can be executed."
